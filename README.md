## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Designed a complete machine learning pipeline:  
  **Data Ingestion → Data Transformation → Model Training → Prediction**
- Designed and implemented data preprocessing pipelines using **One-Hot Encoding** and **Standard Scaler**
- Trained and compared multiple models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Decision Tree Regressor  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
- Performed **hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV** to select the best-performing model
- Built a **Flask web application** for real-time calorie predictions
- Learned **Docker fundamentals** and containerized the application
- Deployed the Dockerized application on **Microsoft Azure Web App** shown in another git repository.
- Deployed the live web application on **Render** for public access
